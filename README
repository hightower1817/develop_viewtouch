Please following steps

STEP 1:tar -xvf develop_viewtouch.tar
extract develop_viewtouch.tar

STEP 2: ./install_pm 
This is a c file that installs the louiedogg perl module and sets permissions

STEP 3: ./develop_viewtouch.pl --help
This now has a help menu, you will need to select from the options.

This is set to pull from Jack's diretory on the original install

Please test the "--install-developer" option as well as the "--install-client" option. Please let me know how it turns out.
The "--update" options you can try, but I am not very confident in the way I set them up yet.
